# M2.6 Work Order — Registry-Boundary Remediation

**Base:** `main` @ `b09ce31` (PR #6, M2.5 merged).
**Branch:** `claude/determined-curie-nkf71s` (restarted from `main`; the prior PR merged).
**Trigger:** Independent fresh-eyes audit of `main` @ `b09ce31` — 1 Critical, 9 High,
1 High-economic, 10 Medium. Every Critical/High cited below was **reproduced against
the actual code before this order was written**; line references are from `b09ce31`.

## Status of the two audits we received

- **Fresh-eyes audit (this one).** Reviewed the merged M2.5 code. Accurate on every
  point checked (8/8 verified). It is the sole source for this work order.
- **"Continuation" audit.** Not a continuation — it re-emitted the 2026-07-16 review
  of pre-M2.5 code. It describes `bondContributors`, bool `submissionExists`, and
  `claimPayout`, all removed in M2.5; cites 91 tests (we have 139) and a
  single-contract architecture (we have three). **It carries no signal about the
  current code and must not be worked from.** A genuine re-audit still needs to be
  run against `b09ce31` or later.

## What M2.5 got right (independently confirmed)

The fresh auditor had no knowledge of the July findings yet independently endorsed
per-case ruleset pinning, commitment domain separation, hard phase windows, fresh
entropy per widen, pull-based appeal payouts, batched settlement, and
transfer-before-credit reward ordering. The seventeen July findings are closed. Do
not re-litigate them.

## The one sentence that matters

**M2.5 moved the bugs to the boundary it created.** Identities are local where they
must be global; liabilities are aggregate where they must be obligation-scoped;
funding rules are written in comments where they must be enforced in code; selected
collateral stays user-mutable where it must be escrowed; and the live draw tree is
treated as an epoch snapshot when it is nothing of the kind.

Note the recurring failure: *the safety property was documented instead of enforced.*
`reward()` carries the comment "caller must transfer the tokens first" and no check.
Every item below must end in a contract-level invariant, not a doc line.

## Rules

1. One work item per commit, `M2.6-<ID>: <summary>`, in the order below.
2. `forge test` green at every commit (baseline **140**, 16 suites, under the default
   `via_ir` profile). No test-count regression.
3. Each item ships the regression test named in it, and the test must fail on the
   pre-fix code. Verify that ordering explicitly.
4. Where an item overturns a DEVIATIONS entry, strike it in the same commit and cite
   the finding.
5. Both conservation identities must hold after every item:
   `balanceOf(Moderation) == openPotsTotal + totalPendingBond + totalPendingPayout + totalSettling`
   and `balanceOf(StakeRegistry) == stakeReg.stakeBuckets()`.

## P0 — deployment blockers

### P0-1. CRITICAL — the permanent index has no global identity

**Confirmed.** `IndexRegistry` keys entries by `(topicKey, caseId)`
(`entryPosPlusOne[topicKey][caseId]`, `IndexRegistry.sol:108`), and `caseId` comes
from each logic contract's own `nextCaseId++` starting at 0 (`Moderation.sol:301,434`).
A replacement logic's first case therefore collides with the original logic's first
case: `writeEntry` appends and **overwrites the reverse-map slot**. The older entry
becomes a ghost — still returned by `entryAt`/pagination, reported absent by
`isIndexed`, and no longer deletable by its identifier. Removal across versions is
impossible anyway: `submitRemoval` resolves the target through the *current* logic's
`cases[targetCaseId]`. Dedup also restarts, since it lives in `Moderation`.

The M2.5 migration test creates exactly this precondition and only asserts the array
length reached two.

**Fix.** Registry-owned identity. `IndexRegistry` mints
`globalEntryId = nextEntryId++` and stores at least `originLogic`, `logicEpoch`,
`localCaseId`, `rulesVersion`/`guidelinesVersion`, plus the existing fields.
Deletion and removal target `globalEntryId`. `writeEntry` must **reject** a reused
global ID rather than overwrite. Move the live-content dedup key into the registry
(or expose a permanent content-generation id) so it survives migration.

**Tests.** Two logics each write their local case 0 → distinct global IDs, both
independently deletable, neither ghosted; a legacy entry is removable through the new
logic; identical content cannot be re-indexed after migration.

### P0-2. Duty reservation must escrow real collateral

**Confirmed.** `drawPanel` increments `dutyReserved` but moves no tokens; the seat's
collateral stays in `free` and stays user-controlled. `penalizeNoShow`
(`StakeRegistry.sol`) opens with `if (m.dutyUnits == 0) return;` and computes
`usable = free − pending − exitAmount`. So a selected moderator escapes the penalty
entirely by either calling `setDutyUnits(0)` (no check that `dutyUnits >= dutyReserved`)
**or** `requestExit(free)` — the exit need not complete. The no-show penalty is the
stated defence against appeal-panel obstruction (H-10); it currently costs nothing.

**Fix.** A distinct `dutyBonded` bucket. At draw, move `riskPerSeat` per reserved seat
`free → dutyBonded`. `dutyBonded` is not exitable, not reducible by `setDutyUnits`,
not available to other cases. Commit converts `dutyBonded → committed`; no-show
freezes it directly; release returns it to `free`. Minimum acceptable alternative if
the bucket is deferred: enforce `dutyUnits >= dutyReserved` and
`exitAmount <= free − dutyReserved * riskPerSeat` — but the bucket is far easier to
prove.

**Tests.** Post-selection `setDutyUnits(0)` and post-selection `requestExit` both
leave the penalty payable and applied; bonded collateral cannot be withdrawn.

### P0-3. Replace the pseudo-epoch with a real one

**Confirmed, broken in both directions.**
*Griefing:* `setDutyUnits` bumps `eligibilityAddVersion` whenever `units > 0` with no
check that the value changed or that weight actually grew — so any pledged moderator
can call `setDutyUnits(sameValue)` after each seed matures and force **every** pending
case to re-arm, indefinitely, for gas. The counter is global, so one actor stalls all
cases. `activate`/`thaw` bump unconditionally too.
*The attack it was meant to stop is still open:* `release`, `reward`, and
`releaseDuty` all add draw-eligible weight and bump the version **zero** times
(verified). Weight removals (`setDutyUnits(0)`, `requestExit`) also don't bump — and
the M2.5 note calling that a benign one-directional residual is wrong: removing an
interval remaps the whole weighted tree, so it is grinding over tree states, not
self-exclusion.

**Fix.** Genuine eligibility epochs. Stake/duty changes made in epoch `e` take effect
in `e+1`; each case pins an epoch root at arm time; all draws for that seed use that
immutable root; no live operation can mutate it. Delete `eligibilityAddVersion`.
Strike the D-8 residual note.

**Tests.** Every weight-changing path (`activate`, `thaw`, `setDutyUnits` up/down,
`requestExit`, `release`, `reward`, `releaseDuty`) cannot alter a draw whose entropy
is already public; repeated no-op `setDutyUnits` cannot delay a draw.

### P0-4. `reward()` must be funded atomically

**Confirmed.** `StakeRegistry.reward()` increments `free` and `totalFreeStake` with no
`transferFrom`, no balance-delta check, no surplus check, no case binding. Honest
`Moderation` transfers first — but the registry does not require it, and the test
pre-mints manually. Any authorized logic (old, new, buggy, or malicious) can mint
withdrawable claims from nothing: `reward(attacker, X)` then `requestExit(X)` then
`withdraw()` drains real stakers' tokens. `requestExit` doesn't even require
`m.exists`.

This makes "the registry isolates principal from replaceable logic" false as written.

**Fix.** `reward` pulls its own funding: measure `balanceOf` before/after a
`transferFrom(msg.sender, ...)` and require the exact delta; or track
`surplus = balance − liabilities` and cap credits by it. Prefer the pull — it also
catches wrong-token funding. Update the trust-model docs to state what the registry
actually guarantees.

**Test.** An authorized-but-unfunded `reward` reverts; conservation cannot be broken
by a hostile logic contract.

### P0-5. Obligation-scoped registry accounting

**Confirmed.** During handover both logics are authorized, and `lock`, `release`,
`freeze`, `releaseDuty`, `setTrack`, `reward` carry no obligation id and no
originating-logic namespace — only aggregates. So logic B can release stake committed
by logic A, freeze A's committed stake under B's case, release A's duty reservations,
or overwrite track A expects; A's later honest settlement can underflow and revert.
`releaseDuty` silently clamps rather than surfacing double release. There is no
on-chain `canRevoke(logic)` — revocation relies on governance *believing* the old
logic drained, and old `Moderation` has no retirement mode, so users can keep opening
cases during the supposed drain.

**Fix.** Creator-scoped obligation handles
(`keccak256(logicEpoch, logic, caseId, depth, moderator)`); only the creating logic
may release or freeze its own obligation. Per-logic open-obligation counters and an
on-chain `canRevoke(logic)`. A `RETIRING` mode on the logic that rejects new
submissions while preserving settlement.

**Tests.** Cross-logic release/freeze/releaseDuty/setTrack all revert; `canRevoke` is
false until counters hit zero; a retiring logic rejects submissions but still settles.

### P0-6. Bounded DRAW terminality

**Confirmed.** `drawPanel` may seat fewer than requested, and the case still enters
COMMIT. If those seats reveal below quorum, `_closeReveal` re-arms and returns to
DRAW — but the stuck case's own reservations keep the tree empty, so
`Moderation.sol:520` reverts `NoEligibleModerators` before any widen attempt can be
consumed. No autonomous terminal path exists. The same holds for a case opened when
no capacity exists at all: the fee is taken and every draw reverts.

**Fix.** Make empty/short draws part of the bounded state machine: consume a
draw-failure attempt, and after the cap resolve as under-quorum, VOID+refund at depth
0, or preserve-prior+refund on appeal — releasing all duty reservations. Add a
draw deadline permitting a permissionless refund when the network has no capacity.

**Test.** A case that exhausts network capacity reaches a terminal state without
external intervention and refunds correctly.

## P1 — correctness and operational quality

### P1-1. Widen seats on an already-committed moderator
Confirmed: settlement branches on `r.committed[a]` alone (`Moderation.sol:873`) and
then releases **all** `r.seats[a]` (`:884`). Extra widen seats are reserved against
network capacity, uncollateralized, untallied, unpenalized, and fully released — a
free capacity sink a high-weight moderator can absorb, deliberately by withholding a
reveal to force the widen. Fix: `topUpCommittedSeats` (lock the delta, raise
`committedSeats`), or exclude already-committed addresses from later widen draws.

### P1-2. Deployment activation
Confirmed: the constructor validates only `riskPerSeat` vs the registry's duty unit.
Add a one-way `activate()` requiring `token != 0`, `token == stakeReg.token()`,
`stakeReg.isLogic(this)`, `indexReg.isLogic(this)`, `guidelinesVersion > 0`, and
expected registry code hashes. `submit`/`submitRemoval` require `active`. A
token-mismatch deployment silently makes the registry insolvent in one asset while
accumulating another.

### P1-3. Parameter validator must model the runtime state space
Confirmed: `_validateParams` iterates `commitTargets.length` (`Moderation.sol:1537`)
while runtime clamps to the last entry — `commitTargets=[400], maxDepth=8, maxWiden=8`
validates as 3,600 draws and executes up to 32,400. Iterate `depth = 0..maxDepth`
using the runtime clamp. Add caps for `freezeCap`, track, `freezeBase * power`, fee
and pot arithmetic; require `trackDecay < WAD`.

### P1-4. Retry economics
Rejection clears the dedup reservation, so identical content is resubmittable at the
base fee — cheaper than the ≥2× pot appeal, with a fresh panel and fresh probabilistic
draw. With per-attempt approval probability `p`, `N` retries succeed with
`1−(1−p)^N`. Persist review history in the **registry** (so migration doesn't reset
it) and price retries: escalating fee, cooldown, or fold resubmission into the
existing appeal ladder.

---

## P2 — economics, semantics, hardening

- **Keeper incentives.** The whole bounty goes to the final batch caller; earlier
  batchers can be front-run and get nothing. Pay per processed seat, or grant the
  initiator a timed completion right.
- **Product semantics.** Decide vote-uncontested vs process-uncontested (a funded
  appeal is arguably a public objection, which the README implies but the code does
  not). Document that ordinary index membership is *not* certification.
- **Pagination stability.** Swap-and-pop reorders arrays; concurrent deletion can make
  a paginating client skip or double-count. Paginate over monotonic global IDs with
  tombstones once P0-1 lands. Harden `cursor + limit` overflow in `supersafeEntries`.
- **Track decay** is event-based, not time-based, despite the docs. Add lazy
  timestamp decay or fix the documentation.
- **Two-step governance transfer on `Moderation`** (the registries already have it);
  reject the zero address.
- **Multi-seat no-show** costs only one seat's worth. Consider
  `penaltyUnits = min(seats, P_max)`.
- **Randomness** remains proposer-influenceable; compare per-case controllable value
  against that cost, and plan a VRF/beacon path.
- **Draws are capacity-depleting, not with-replacement.** Simulations and docs must
  model the actual process; binomial conclusions are invalid.
- **Code size.** 1,184 B of headroom under `via_ir`. CI must block on exact compiler
  version, optimizer settings, `via_ir`, and size.
- **Economic re-validation** and an **independent re-audit of the three-contract
  architecture** — still outstanding, and now more clearly required than before.

## Sequencing

P0-1 (index identity) and P0-4 (reward funding) are independent and can land first —
P0-4 is small and closes the only path to unfunded withdrawable claims, so do it
first. P0-2 (duty bonding) and P0-3 (epochs) both rewrite `StakeRegistry` eligibility
state; do them adjacently, epochs after bonding. P0-5 (obligation scoping) touches
every privileged API, so it lands after P0-2/3 have settled their shapes. P0-6 is
independent. P1-1 depends on P0-2's bonding. Everything else follows.

## Standing recommendation — unchanged

No deployment with material funds, and the index is not presented as reliable
safe-search certification, until P0 closes and an independent re-audit of the
three-contract architecture passes. Treat the current code as an advanced prototype.
